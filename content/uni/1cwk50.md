## Part I: Introduction
### Prologue
A month or two ago I was given an assignment to do as part of my university coursework ‚Äì it was to be a Java-based desktop app to help a user do something.

This is my development log.

<p align="center" style="margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:2rem;">
    <img src="/img/1cwk50/newhotel.png" alt="" width="550" />
</p>

I spent the first week thinking about what to make ‚Äì the original brief states that we must have a project with *two* feature-sets and debugging capabilities, which I mainly take to mean [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing). The project that we could create had a wide scope; as long as it passes by our tutors, it can be made.

With all of this in mind, I chose to make a hotel booking application to aid a few friendly multinational hotel conglomerates who *definitely* know about this project üëê
### Setting up
To set up the development environment for this project, I installed the [Java plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) into [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), my typical development environment.

<p align="center" style="margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:2rem;">
    <img src="/img/1cwk50/Pasted image 20240513170254.png" alt="" />
</p>

With the extension pack installed, I initialised [git](https://git-scm.com/), the most popular [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system, into the project. I am using version control because it helps me track/prove my progress, revert bad changes into the program, and because I'm already used to using it in my workflow:

```shell
$ git init
```
### Project Structure
A booking system has many facets to managing entities coming in/out of the system. One of my main skillsets outside of university is web development, and I thought HotelBooker would be a good platform to emulate some common [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API) functionality, even if it's an offline application. 

Users should be able to enter the application and use it to make decisions of how/who/what hotels to book. For this, I chose to create a structured hierarchy of actions & decisions which users can make during their [flow](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-journeys-vs-user-flows/), dating all the way back to the planning phase of this system üèóÔ∏è

The original flow for the application looked like this:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:2rem;">
    <img src="/img/1cwk50/Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 17.13.41.png" alt=""  />
</p>

I'd like to note a caveat here: this isn't the final iteration of the flow.
### Entities
To simplify this overstretched diagram, my intention was to have some defined entities which interacted together:

- **Hotel** ‚Äì One of many hotels a customer can book
- **Customer** ‚Äì A single customer for a reservation
- **Booking** ‚Äì¬†A contract between a hotel and customer
- **Room** ‚Äì¬†A room inside of the hotel the booking connects to
- **Booking date** ‚Äì¬†The date to book a single room

Overall, I designed the system to have many hotels, many customers in each hotel, who can book into rooms on specific dates. Each entity is unique and has a loose relationship in the database backend I chose; I'll do that later.
## Part II: The Basics
To implement the project, I started out by typing [`ctrl + p`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) into my keyboard to open the command palette, then [`create new maven‚Ä¶`](https://maven.apache.org/) to initialise the boilerplate. With the basics added, I committed it:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:2rem;">
    <img src="/img/1cwk50/Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 17.42.58.png" alt="" width="600" />
</p>

My second commit to the repository was titled "Implemented general classes for hotel". In this change, I laid out the framework for the entities HotelBooker relies on:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:2rem;">
    <img src="/img/1cwk50/Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 17.55.43.png" alt="" width="600" />
</p>

### The Hotel Class
Let's look at the *Hotel* class first, as it's currently the top-level of our hierarchy:

```java
package com.ogriffiths;

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.UUID;

public class Hotel {
    public UUID id;
    public String name;
	
    public HashSet<Room> rooms;
    public HashSet<Customer> customers;

    public Hotel(String name) {
        this.id = UUID.randomUUID();
        this.name = name;
        this.rooms = new HashSet<>();
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        String truncatedId = id.toString().substring(5);
        int roomCount = rooms.size();
        String roomPlural = roomCount == 1 ? "" : "s";
        return String.format(
            "%s (%s); %s room%s hotel", 
            name, truncatedId, roomCount, roomPlural
        );
    }
}
```

As you can see, this class has scaffolded the core of what entities should have:

1. ‚úÖ Unique identifier
2. ‚úÖ Many rooms (w/relationship)
3. ‚úÖ Many customers (w/relationship)
4. ‚úÖ Constructor
5. ‚úÖ Display override

The only special part of this class now is the `toString` method [override](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overriding-in-java/), which lets me easily represent this hotel as a string in a standard-library-conforming and reusable manner; throughout this project I've used features in Java to make my project easier to write and *maintainable*.
### The RoomBookings Class
The last class from this commit which I'd like to showcase is the *RoomBookings* class:

```java
package com.ogriffiths;

import java.lang.ref.Reference;
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class RoomBookings {
    private HashMap<LocalDate, Reference<Customer>> bookings;
	
    public RoomBookings() {
        this.bookings = new HashMap<>();
    }
	
    public boolean book(LocalDate date, Reference<Customer> customer) {
        if (bookings.get(date) == null) {
            bookings.put(date, customer);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
	
	@Override
	public String toString() {
        ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();
        for(LocalDate date: bookings.keySet()) {
            Reference<Customer> customer= bookings.get(date)
            lines.add(String.format("%s: %s", date, customer.get().toString()));
        }
        return String.join(" ", lines);
    }
}
```

Take note of the [HashMap](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/fscp-complex-data-structures/modules/fecp-hash-maps/cheatsheet) data structure I've leveraged; this is a common thread throughout HotelBooker. HashMaps are a great way to represent KV Stores which was originally the way I chose to represent bookings:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:2rem;">
    <img src="/img/1cwk50/Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 18.34.21.png" alt="" width="700" />
</p>

You can also start to see the setup of loosely relational data here ‚Äì the structure is `HashMap<LocalDate, Reference<Customer>>` which refers to the customers stored in the *Hotel* class shown previously ‚ú®

The last item of note here is my use of for loops to iterate over all of the bookings in the `toString` override, this demonstrates my use of [iteration](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zg46tfr/revision/1).
### The Database System
Every entity class inside of HotelBooker is serialised/deserialised with the use of [gson](https://github.com/google/gson):

> A Java serialization/deserialization library to convert Java Objects into JSON and back

This is controlled by the *Database* class:

```java
package com.ogriffiths;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.UUID;

import com.google.gson.Gson;
import com.google.gson.GsonBuilder;

public class Database {
    private HashMap<UUID, Hotel> hotels;
    private String resourcePath;

    Database(String resourcePath) {
        this.hotels = new HashMap<>();
        this.resourcePath = resourcePath;
    }

    public static Database load(String resourcePath) throws FileNotFoundException {
        String path = Main.class.getResource(resourcePath).getPath();
        File file = new File(path);
        Scanner fileReader = new Scanner(file);

        String contents = "";
        try {
            while (fileReader.hasNextLine()) {
                contents += fileReader.nextLine();
                contents += "\n";
            }
        } finally {
            fileReader.close();
        }

        Gson gson = getDeserializer();
        Database db = gson.fromJson(contents, Database.class);

        if (db == null) {
            System.out.println(
	            "Could not find previous database, creating new one"
	        );
            db = new Database(resourcePath);
        } else {
            db.resourcePath = resourcePath;
        }
        return db;
    }

    public void save() {
        Gson gson = getDeserializer();
        String payload = gson.toJson(this);

        String path = Main.class.getResource(resourcePath).getPath();
        File file = new File(path);
        try (PrintWriter fileWriter = new PrintWriter(file)) {
            try {
                System.out.println("Saving changes..");
                fileWriter.write(payload);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println(
	                String.format(
		                "Failed to save database to file (%s)",
		                e.getMessage()
		            )
		        );
            } finally {
                fileWriter.close();
            }
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println(
	            String.format(
		            "Failed to load database file to save to (%s)", 
		            e.getMessage()
		        )
		    );
        }
    }

    public boolean addHotel(Hotel hotel) {
        // Truncated for blog‚Ä¶
    }

    public HashMap<UUID, Hotel> getHotels() {
        // Truncated for blog‚Ä¶
    }

    public Hotel getHotel(UUID id) {
        // Truncated for blog‚Ä¶
    }

    private static Gson getDeserializer() {
        GsonBuilder gsonBuilder = new GsonBuilder();
        gsonBuilder.registerTypeAdapter(
	        LocalDate.class,
	        new LocalDateTypeAdapter()
	    );

        Gson gson = gsonBuilder.setPrettyPrinting().create();
        return gson;
    }
}
```

Some methods of note:

- üíæ `load` will [deserialise](https://mkyong.com/java/java-read-a-file-from-resources-folder/) all hotels from the file provided
- üíæ `save` will [serialise](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_files_create.asp) all hotels to the file provided
- üéÅ `getDeserializer` will generate a [custom](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6096940/how-do-i-write-a-custom-json-deserializer-for-gson) deserialiser for dates
### The Selector System
There are multiple places where users have a choice of what they want to pick, so I made a class called *Selector* which has a list of options and automatically generates an input box for them:

```java
package com.ogriffiths;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Selector {
    private String quitOption;
    protected HashMap<String, String> options;

    static String divider = "--------------------";

    protected Selector(HashMap<String, String> options, String quitOption) {
        // Shown later‚Ä¶
    }

    public String listSelect(Scanner stdin) {
        // Truncated for blog‚Ä¶
    }

    private String listSelectOnce(Scanner stdin) {
        // Shown later‚Ä¶
    }

    private String generateStartMessage() {
        // Truncated for blog‚Ä¶
    }

    private static int parseUserChoice(String choice) {
        // Truncated for blog‚Ä¶
    }
}
```

There's another use of a HashMap here, but I'd like to have a look at the constructor first:

```java
protected Selector(HashMap<String, String> options, String quitOption) {
    if (options.size() == 0) {
        throw new SelectorException("Options cannot have no choices inside of it");
    }
    this.quitOption = quitOption;
    this.options = options;
}
```

You can see my first use of a [selection](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zh66pbk/revision/6) here ‚Äì an if statement to validate if there were any options passed into this constructor to aid debugging. There isn't good [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) in Java like there is in languages like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), so runtime errors are the substitute.

I'd also like to present `listSelectOnce` for the sake of completeness regarding iteration/selection:

```java
private String listSelectOnce(Scanner stdin) {
    System.out.println(generateStartMessage());

    ArrayList<String> tiedKeys = new ArrayList<>();

    String[] keys = options.keySet().toArray(new String[options.size()]);
    Arrays.sort(keys);

    for (String key : keys) {
        String message = options.get(key);
        int index = tiedKeys.size() + 1;
        System.out.println(String.format("%s: %s", index, message));
        tiedKeys.add(key);
    }

    if (quitOption != null) {
        System.out.println(
            String.format("%s: %s", tiedKeys.size() + 1, quitOption)
        );
        tiedKeys.add("quit");
    }

    System.out.print("Your choice: ");
    String rawChoice = stdin.nextLine();
    int choice;
    try {
        choice = parseUserChoice(rawChoice);
    } catch (Exception err) {
        throw new SelectorException(
            String.format(
                "Could not parse choice '%s' to integer", rawChoice
            ),
            err
        );
    }

    String selected;
    try {
        selected = tiedKeys.get(choice);
    } catch (Exception err) {
        throw new SelectorException(
            String.format("Choice %s is too high or low", choice),
            err
        );
    }

    System.out.println(divider);

    return selected;
}
```

You can see the use of [`protected`](https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_keyword_protected.asp) and [`private`](https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_keyword_private.asp) methods here, used to tweak visibility. I like to think of cybersecurity's [PoLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) when it comes to this üôÇ
### The Story System
My two feature-sets for this project are managing multiple hotels, and managing multiple customer's bookings, all with File I/O from my JSON-based database.

To construct the user journey, I have made an inheritance system made of many *Story* classes:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:2rem;">
    <img src="/img/1cwk50/Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 19.06.29.png" alt="" />
</p>

Stories are set out as an interface, defining commonality between all stories:

```java
package com.ogriffiths;

import java.util.Scanner;

public interface Story {
    static String divider = "--------------------";

    public void launch(Database db, Scanner stdin);
}
```

Let's see one of these stories in action. This is the *LoginHotelStory* which implements the *Selector* interface and *Story* class to show options to the user once they log into their provided hotel:

```java
package com.ogriffiths.Stories;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.UUID;

import com.ogriffiths.Database;
import com.ogriffiths.Hotel;
import com.ogriffiths.Selector;
import com.ogriffiths.Story;

public class LoginHotelStory extends Selector implements Story {
    public LoginHotelStory() {
        super(new HashMap<String, String>() {
            {
                put("roomlist", "üõå List all rooms in this hotel");
                put("roomadd", "üõå Add a new room to this hotel");
                put("roomdelete", "üõå Delete a room from this hotel");
                put("customerlist", "üßë List all registered customers");
                put("customeradd", "üßë Register a new customer");
                put("bookinglist", "üí∏ List all bookings in this hotel");
                put("bookingadd", "üí∏ Add a new booking to this hotel");
                put("bookingdelete", "üí∏ Delete a booking from this hotel");

            }
        }, "üß® Log out of this hotel panel");
    }

    @Override
    public void launch(Database db, Scanner stdin) {
        ListHotelsStory listHotelsStory = new ListHotelsStory();
        listHotelsStory.launch(db, stdin);
        if (db.getHotels().isEmpty()) {
            return; // NOTE: No hotels to login to, list handles output
        }

        Hotel hotel = getHotel(db, stdin);
        if (hotel == null) {
            System.out.println(divider);
            return;
        }

        System.out.println(divider);
        System.out.println(String.format("Logging into %s", hotel));
        System.out.println("Please wait..");
        fakeLoading();
        System.out.println("Logged in successfully!");
        System.out.println(divider);

        continualOptions(db, hotel, stdin);
    }

    private Hotel getHotel(Database db, Scanner stdin) {
        // Truncated for blog‚Ä¶
    }

    private String inputHotelId(Scanner stdin) {
        // Truncated for blog‚Ä¶
    }

    private static void fakeLoading() {
        // Truncated for blog‚Ä¶
    }

    private void continualOptions(Database db, Hotel hotel, Scanner stdin) {
        while (true) {
            String choice = listSelect(stdin);
            switch (choice) {
                case "roomlist":
                    ListRoomsStory listRoomsStory = new ListRoomsStory();
                    listRoomsStory.launch(db, hotel, stdin);
                    break;
                // More cases here, truncated for blog‚Ä¶
                default:
                    System.out.println(divider);
                    return;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

I've also made use of a [switch-case](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_switch.asp) expression here ‚Äì this lets me match cases for each option picked so I can patch the next option through once the user selects it.

Because this is a selector, I wanted to make sure the options are shown continually when a story finishes; when it's `launch` function returns *without* throwing an [exception](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Exception.html). I have used a `while (true)` statement to loop forever to accomplish this.

Overall, I've used the slightly more advanced constructs of [inheritance](https://stackify.com/oop-concept-inheritance/) and [polymorphism](https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/polymorphism/) to extend the properties of the *Selector* class, whilst also using interfaces to define commonality between stories:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:2rem;">
    <img src="/img/1cwk50/Pasted image 20240513194155.png" alt="" width="300" />
</p>
## Recursion
The last programming construct I'd like to touch on in this post is recursion. I've used it throughout HotelBooker in a limited manner.

There are a few cases in the project where I've needed to loop if a user provides invalid input, so I've recursed the input function back in on itself instead of having a bulky loop, for example in the *DeleteBookingStory*:

```java
private boolean getConfirmation(Scanner stdin) {
    System.out.print("Please confirm removal (y/n): ");
    String confirm = stdin.nextLine().toLowerCase();
    if (confirm.equals("y") || confirm.equals("yes")) {
        return true;
    } else if (confirm.equals("n") || confirm.equals("b") || confirm.equals("no")) {
        System.out.println("Cancelled unbooking this room successfully");
        System.out.println(divider);
        return false;
    } else {
        System.out.println("That's not a valid confirmation, please try again");
        return getConfirmation(stdin);
    }
}
```
## Part III: Testing
During development, I didn't initially implement unit tests because the nature of the project didn't call for it. There were only a couple places which I *could* easily unit test, and those were covered by [manual testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_testing).

<p align="center" style="margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:2rem;">
    <img src="/img/1cwk50/Pasted image 20240513202709.png" alt="" width="600" />
</p>

Towards the end of the project, developing slowed down due to this [tech debt](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/technical-debt/). Therefore, I decided to patch the system up with unit tests; especially because I started to implement helper methods for aspects like [CRUD'ing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) entities.

To test, I used the [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) library and wrote tests for virtually every non-`launch` method, here's an example from *CustomerTest*:

```java
package com.ogriffiths;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.util.Scanner;

import org.junit.Test;

public class CustomerTest {
    @Test
    public void testConstructor() {
        Customer customer = new Customer("John Doe");
        assertEquals("John Doe", customer.name);
    }

    @Test
    public void testToString() {
        Customer customer = new Customer("John Doe");
        assertEquals(
	        String.format("John Doe (%s)", customer.id),
	        customer.toString()
	    );
    }

    @Test
    public void testFromStdin() {
        Database db = new Database("/db.json");
        Hotel hotel = new Hotel("Hotel Budapest");
        Scanner stdin = generateStdin("John Doe\n");
        Customer customer = Customer.fromStdin(db, hotel, stdin);
        assertEquals("John Doe", customer.name);
    }

    private Scanner generateStdin(String input) {
        InputStream stdin = new ByteArrayInputStream(input.getBytes());
        return new Scanner(stdin);
    }
}
```

I opted to not unit test stories in favour of manual tests, the scale is small and they're extremely UI-based, something which I can't easily test for and something which changes quickly, inflicting high [cost of change](https://www.praxisframework.org/en/library/cost-of-change).
